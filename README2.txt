1. STORY BACKGROUND

INSPIRATION / BACKGROUND:
		
PROJECT RPG, IS AN EARLY VERSION GAMEBUILD OF A PROJECTED YEARLONG GAME DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY. GAME DEVELOPMENT CAN TAKE MANY YEARS, BUT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PROFITS IF THE GAME IS MARKETED WELL, RELEASED IN A PLAYABLE STATE, AND PROVIDES A FUN CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP. PROJECT RPG IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A ONGOING GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE, WITH HIGH REPLAY VALUE. THE GAME IS SIMULATION BASED, WHICH MEANS THERE IS NO CONCRETE BEGINNING AND END, BUT OFFERS OPEN GAMEPLAY AT ANY TIME.
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A NEW EXPERIENCE, I'VE BEEN INSPIRED BY REAL WORLD BUSINESSES SUCH AS GAMESTOP, EBAY, AND DKOLDIES.

THESE BUSINESSES OPERATE AS USED GAME STORES, AND PROFIT FROM SELLING USED AND NEW PRODUCTS. THIS INTRODUCES THE POSSIBILITY FOR MANY GAMEPLAY VARIABLES, SUCH AS PRICING, CONDITION, MARKET TRENDS, AND BUSINESS SCALING.

PROJECT RPG OPERATES AS A USED GAME STORE, WHICH BEGINS AS A BUSINESS IN DEBT. THE PLAYER / BUSINESS STARTS THE GAME AT -500 USD, AND MUST MONITOR AND SELL PRODUCTS AT A PROFIT USING A ONLINE USED WEBSTORE SIMILAR TO EBAY.COM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GAME OBJECTIVES:

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS SIMPLE: BUY AND SELL PRODUCT UNTIL YOU HAVE ACHIEVED A PROFITBALE BUSINESS STATUE.
